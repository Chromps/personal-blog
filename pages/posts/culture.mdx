### So what is dev culture anyways?

This is the question in HR minds around the world as company culture is spun into Taco Tuesday, Ping Pong Tables, and Free Lunch.
Although these are awesome perks (current job has a few, and seriously HR I appreciate you), they aren't going to make or break a
job for me. No, to me Dev culture is something more fundamental. For me, it breaks down as:

-   Are my dev skills valued, or am I a coding monkey?
-   Am I making the product better?
-   Am I learning new skills?

### Let me explain

The above may sound oversimplified, that's intentional. My point with this post is no matter how many 'perks' you have, Devs generally want to leave the software
they are working on better than when they started. This means you occasionally have to let a Dev run with something. So, maybe you loose a couple days to an idea
that did not work out. Is that worth having a happy developer, who has learned a new skill that can be applied in the future? I think so, and most of the Devs
I know would agree. Sometimes, you might even get a tool or enhancement that saves 100s of hours of developer work per year. Pick any engineer on your team and
ask them if they have any ideas to improve the application, I'm sure you will find some great ideas that have been in hiding.

### What about the bottom line?!

Obviously, I'm not advocating that we do not have to do actual work that, you know, keeps the business running and profitable. I'm just suggesting a different
approach to dev culture that focuesses on their core values, not their stomach and leisure. Sometimes it's worth risking a couple days of work to keep your engineers happy
and excited about the application they are working on.

### It's not always easy

I'm speaking from personal experience here: Advocating for this stuff can be hard, but it is absolutely possible. At current role, I am pitching a
project to re-write our frontend in React.js, migrating from a very old and rigid JSP implementation. It's taking months of pitching the pros to my management to
get them interested in the idea, but things are now starting to roll, and I've been given the green light to create a prototype implementation to prove the viability.
There were times this felt like a losing battle, but now that the light is shining through, I'm more excited than ever to work on this 'legacy' application.
