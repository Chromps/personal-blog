### So what is dev culture anyways?

This is the question in HR minds around the world as company culture is spun into Taco Tuesday, Ping Pong Tables, and Free Beer.
Although these are awesome perks (current job has a few, and seriously HR I appreciate you), they aren't going to make or break a
job for me. No, to me Dev culture is something more fundamental. For me, it breaks down as:

-   Are my dev skills valued, or am I a coding monkey?
-   Am I making the product better?
-   Am I learning new skills?

### Let me explain

The above may sound oversimplified, that's intentional. My point with this post is no matter how many 'perks' you have, Devs generally want to leave the software
they are working on better than when they started. This means you occasionally have to let a Dev run with something. So, maybe you loose a couple days to an idea
that did not work out. Is that worth having a happy developer, who has learned a new skill that can be applied in the future? I think so, and most of the Devs
I know would agree. Sometimes, you might even get a tool or enhancement that saves 100s of hours of developer work per year.

### It's not always roses

Obviously, I'm not advocating that we do not have to do actual work that, you know, keeps the business running and profiting. I'm just suggesting a different
approach to dev culture that focuesses on their core values, not their stomach.
