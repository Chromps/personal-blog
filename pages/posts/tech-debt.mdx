Ahhh tech debt, every developers old friend. We do not set out to write cumbersome features, so how do so many creep into our codebase?
Were previous developers maliciously plotting against us?  Is everyone secretly out to get us? How did we even get here?!

### What it is.

I have the honor of working with a profitable legacy codebase at my job.  
To give some backround: My team (abstractly) adds new users to our application. Sounds like a fairly simple task, yes?  
Would you be surprised to hear that it takes us, at a minimum, _hundreds of hours_ to accomplish this?

How could it possibly take this long, you may be asking. The answer is **Tech Debt**.

Believe it or not, the process used to take much longer. We are part of a specialized team that only works on this aspect of the application.

### What it isn't

So your application is built on legacy product Z. Z was the new hotness in 2007, but isn't used for new projects.
