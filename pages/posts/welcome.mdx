### Hello!

Welcome to my blog!

---

I've tried blogging before, but it has never stuck. To be completely honest, this project has started with the intnet of getting
more familiar with Next.js, so I'm not off to the best start :). My goal, however, will be to write one blog post a week. I have
recently learned of the 'Digital Minimalist' philosophy, and plan to blog about my experience in attempting to adopt it.

##### I'm also a software engineer and will talk about software regularly

You'll have to bear with me on this. I like to talk about problems in software and how they can be overcome in the 'real world'.
I'll talk through examples at my job that have lead to some interesting solutions.

Thanks for joining me!

Until next time.
