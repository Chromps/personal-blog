### Why I Am Choosing Less

Over the past month I have drastically reduced my technology usage outside of work, and have slowly been working to streamline my life as well.
I've noticed a huge difference in my attention span and my ability to think about problems for a long period of time. I have also been
able to accomplish things that I have been putting off for months, such as selling unused audio equipment (I'm a recovering audiophile).

### Simplifying My Life

This may sound cliche, but it's a huge benefit for me. I love reading, but found myself only reading a few books a year. Since adopting
the 'digital minimalism' philosophy in my life, I've managed to read almost 3 books in a month. I also have much more time to play with
my awesome doggo, and she's super happy about it.

Reducing the amount of tech I use means I occasionally miss out on Instagram posts and Facebook status updates, but what I am realizing is these things
do not need to be consumed in real time. After initially cutting off Instagram completely, I've now alotted myself 1 check of my feed every other day.
Rules are: No stories, scroll only until I reach a post I recognize, and no explore page. I've found this approach allows me to still keep tabs
on what my friend are doing, but does not suck me in for hours on end as it used to.

### Simplifying My Code

The minimlaist philosophy has re-affirmed some long-standing ideas I've had about the complexity of the software we write. There are several
examples of overly complex code at work, all of which was written with nothing but the best intentions. In practice, however, it provides multiple layers
of difficult to follow logic and often makes things much more difficult to implement. I'm realising sometimes the simplest solution _is_ the best solution,
assuming it adresses all the clients requirements. In the long run, it will be easier to maintain and reason about, and future enhancements can be
designed when needed vs when first thought about.
