### Hi! I'm Cody Swift.

##### Who Are you?

I'm a 28 year old Software Engineer, working primarily in legacy Java and React. It's a weird combination, I know.
I have been working as a 'professional' engineer for 2 years now, after completing my Associate's Degree in 2017.
Before engineering, I worked a couple manual labor jobs... Let's just say I really appreciate being indoors now!

##### Why would you do this?

Good question! My goal with this blog is to share my progress as an Engineer. This will cover a broad range of topics, not always engineering related.  
Topics may include:

-   Programming
-   Philosophy
-   Dogs
